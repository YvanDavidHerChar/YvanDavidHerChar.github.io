Abstract:
Biochar physicochemical properties are sensitive to feedstock and processing parameters. 
However, the effect of feedstock on thermomechanical properties of biochar-filled plastics is not well understood. 
This study characterizes the differences found between three polymeric matrices filled with biochar from two different feedstocks (i.e., dairy manure, and wood chip). 
Mechanical, thermal, and morphological testing was performed on three polymeric matrices: polypropylene (PP), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polylactic acid (PLA).
Biochar feedstock affected the strength and ductility of filled plastics as well as the thermal behavior. Moreover, the effect was different depending on the matrix. 
Statistical differences were identified for the PLA and PCL samples, specifically the tensile strength varied by a factor of 1.5, and elongation at break by a factor of 2. 
These differences might be attributed to the moisture content, which was double (~6 wt%) for dairy manure biochar compared to wood chip biochar. 
Thermal characterization showed differences in the PLA matrix, with the crystallization behavior altered by feedstock type. 
PLA filled with dairy manure showed reduced crystallization in second heat in the DSC, which was counter to the behavior of PLA filled with wood chip biochar. 
Thus, wood chip biochar was the preferable choice of filler for PLA. These results indicate that biochar feedstock is an important design consideration when using biochar as a filler in plastics. 
In addition, the interactions between biochar feedstock and polymeric matrix type need to be taken into account.
