Hello! My name is Yvan David Hernandez-Charpak, a french-colombian scientist, entrepreneur, adventurer, traveler and person. I am curently a PhD candidate in Sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

This site will layout my work, my research and provide some (hopefully usefull) ressources. 

My [**project**](./projects) is to change the way you think about waste. Through **biochar**, we can consolidate the carbon present in our _organic_ waste (from our agriculture or food waste!). My projects focuses on the value chains for biochar, making it a agent of circular economy and carbon sequestration. 



My [**research**](./research) contains the list of my academic publications, from my early 2020 undegraduate projects, up to my PhD articles and (soon!) dissertation! Briefly, I approach thematics similar to:
- Biochar characterization
- Biochar production
- Social Engineering
- Plastic biodegradation
- Plastic characterization
- Plastic film production
- Plastics in Agriculture
- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
- Techno Economical Analysis (TEA) 

If you are interested in learning more about any of these concepts, I would be happy to have a conversation with you! Don't doubt connecting with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ydhc/) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YvanDavidHernan)
